# Semi/Un Supervised Learning

## Embedding
- Discrete token, carries a lot of meaning (not like pixels in vision)

- Generative models:
	- Auto-regressive (RNN/CNN/Transformers) are good at generating short sentences.

	- Retrieval-based

- Generate documents (open challenges):
	- are coherent,
	- how to keep track of state,
	- how to model uncertainty,
		- M. Ott et al. Analyzing uncertainty in NMT, ICML 2018
	- how to ground,
		- starting with D. Roy / J. Siskind’s work from early 2000’s
	- meaningful metrics & standardized tasks!
- Unsupervised Translation:
	- A. Conneau et al. Word translation without parallel data, ICLR 2018
		- https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE
		- https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText
		- W = argmin||Wx-y||^2
		- No pair data, so fool discrimitor for Wx and y
		- Nearest neighbor for refinements
		- Orthogonality

- **Work**:
	- Unsup on several applications
	- Word embeddings
	- Text gen of short sentences
- **Sort-of-Work**:
	- Sentence embedding
	- Unsup MT under some conditions
- **Does-not-Work-yet**:
	- Modeling long documents
