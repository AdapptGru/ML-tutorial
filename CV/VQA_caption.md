	- This is an interpretable VQA model that disentangles language reasoning from visual understanding
	- For visual understanding, they first perform objects segmentation and then learn to obtain structural scene representation (with supervision) such as color, size, shape, position.
	- For language reasoning, they learn to translate natural language question into a deterministic program such as filter_shape(scene, large) or count(scene). 
	- Finally, they execute the program on the structural scene representation to obtain the final answer
